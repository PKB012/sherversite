Users and Administrators
Security- in case someone uploads a harmful file knowingly or unknowingly. ã€‹Solution: antivirus or else the files of users should be always quarantined.
Security- to prevent hacking or bypass login-> no one can run any script, etc. (Not sure about it. Check it #DBR #Bhendi)
Files of every user should be kept separately and can be shared with selected or all users with permission.
